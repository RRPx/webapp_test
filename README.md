- Impressions

This assignment provided a well-rounded opportunity to build a social feed app from scratch with modern frameworks.
NestJS with TypeORM offered great developer ergonomics for building scalable APIs.
React’s flexibility made it easy to structure reusable UI and handle API state.
I enjoyed the challenge and focused on functional correctness and clean architecture, as design was not a priority.
